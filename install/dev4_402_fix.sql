(1, 8, 'webmaster', 'Welcome to PHP-Nuke Titanium', '2017-10-11 09:56:20', '2023-01-16 01:29:13', '<p>Thank you for choosing PHP-Nuke Titanium v4.0.3, we hope you enjoy using our CMS and we appreciate all the feedback and donations. This software started out using the Nuke-Evolution Xtreme 2.0.9f Core engine and we are very proud to say so. This is the AN602 version of PHP-Nuke Titanium. PHP-Nuke Titanium was at one time designed to run solely on The 86it Developers Network.</p>\n\n<p>Some folks were not a general part of the network and just wanted a regular website or portal and in those instances, we would set up Nuke-Evolution Xtreme (US Version).</p>\n\n<p>Understanding which one you needed was a big part of starting an online presence. The decision is one that we would always help you with...</p>\n\n<p>PHP-Nuke Titanium is no longer Network dependant and users have the option to turn the network on and off if needed. The network was and is still used to share debug info and bug reports with groups of developers. It allows other developers to chime in and or offer support when it comes to writing code of various types.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of folks drive around in old beater cars because it gets them from point A to point B. Some folks use Bootstrap for layouts and design, and Bootstarap is sort of the Uber of the online programming world. And then there are Scientist who fly to the moon, and those are the people that write their own code and explore the frameworks of others&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of programmers out there and many of them think they know everything, and some of them actually do. The Lead Programmer for PHP-Nukre Titanium has been programming since before the internet existed and has spent a lot of time learning various programming languages.</p>\n\n<p>PHP-Nuke Titanium uses what has been dubbed as the Francis Framework. The Francis Frameork was created in a moment of brilliance and was born out of Thatware from many years back. The reason people call it that is because a fella by the Name of Francisco Burzi &quot;who did not speak very good english by the way&quot; was responsible for the worlds very first CMS.</p>\n\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h2><strong>The Programmer Behind PHP-Nuke Titanium</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The programmer &quot;Ernest Allen Buffington&quot; responsible for PHP-Nuke Titanium was born in the 1900&#39;s and he has been programming in and with just about any language he could get his hands on over the years. Learning SYNTAX and coming up with new IDEAS.</p>\n\n<p>When everything was dial up from the 1200 baud modem all the way up to the 56K, he would do amazing things in Pascal. He spent his life exploring SYNTAX and learning new programming concepts. In the early days he would design intense dial up GUI interfaces that had to respond and load for connections that are compared to today&#39;s standards insanely slow.</p>\n\n<p>The OpenSource world has allowed Ernest and many others to explore code and gists from others around the world. Make no mistake that someone who spends their life programming and loves to program is a different kind of person altogether. Ernest has been studying and exploring and watching since the internet was born and before Netscape Explorere was born. He has been around since before Microsft designed their 1st web browser with a graphic user interface.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people claim to know a lot and some of them do. Ernest has never really said much or claimed anything. In fact over the many years he has been programming the only person he ever really shared his ideas and code with was family and friends. Leaps and bounds ahead of Mark Zuckerburg and even Tom Anderson the original person responsible for writing the MySpace code. Many great programmers got lost in the search for money. Tom Anderson sold out to Rupert Murdoch, who had no way of knowing that just because he bought the company, it did not mean it would be successful. Sometimes money makes you dumb as shit. My hat is off to Tom Anderson because Rupert Murdoch had no idea he was burning&nbsp;$580 million dollars when he bought myspace.com.</p>\n\n<p>I can tell you one thing, change and greed are the things that destroy success in the programming world. Ernest has never been greedy and always pretty much was well to do. Never needing anything or anyone gives a person a lot of time to study and learn things the average person probably just does not have time to explore, unless they do it professionally.</p>\n\n<p>You never really get ahead because the more money you make the more money the government takes. Ernest Buffington says &quot;pretty much throughout life we are all just treading the waters of survival and living paycheck to paycheck&quot; and he is very sad about the direction many of the talented individuals and programmers ended up choosing. Many of them just gave up or abandoned hope and that is a horrible thing to do when you have folks that follow and worship you. This is why Ernest never established an online presence with followers, he was never one to leave folks behind or dictate what others do. He said if he ever did have an online presence or website it would be one where everyone has as many choices and options as he could create.</p>\n\n<p>He for years was a Ghost and invisible, watching day in and day out, the folks creating code and new projects, technology changing. One of the things that haunts Ernest is the pace at which versioning is taking place, for different various programming languages the pace is slow and for others it is moving in stereo and hauling ass he would say.</p>\n\n<p>One of things he hates is when PHP removes functions instead of fixing them, there is absolutely no reason for it he would say. When they do that they break code everywhere. It&#39;s like a nuclear bomb going of in the online world. Fix your shit he would say... Stop removing shit that could have been built upon. Age and maturity have everything to do with being a good programmer and in many cases like FireFox and even Adobe you can see what happens when we let the youngins make corporate decions. They all remind me of the senseless spending that Ruper Murdoch would do just because he was a billionaire mogul. Guess what? He is dead and died hated...</p>\n\n<p>His words of wisdom are &quot;If your head is up your ass, everything you learn will be shit!&quot; the other is epic and that and it is &quot;It takes a Savant or a Village!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 1806, 1, 'webmaster', '', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, 85, 17, '', 0, 1),

You will need to delete the old <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> file that is in the root directory of your portal/website as it is no longer used. The new <strong>sitemap.xml</strong> file is generated in the <strong>xmls/sitemap</strong> folder.

You can configure this block so that it changes for cell phones and different resolution monitors, It can even be configured for 4k TV.</p>\n\n<p>This block checks your monitor resolution and displays the visitor log in rows and columns, A row is a series of data put out horizontally in a table or spreadsheet while a column is a vertical series of cells in a chart, table, or spreadsheet. Rows go from left to right. On the other hand, Columns are arranged from up to down. After this block gets your monitor resolution width it will decide how many columns and rows to display. If your resolution width is less than 1920 it will display 3 columns, if it is 1920 or above it will display 4 columns. You can configure this block for any resolution and the code is obvious. Just add tables with rows and columns and display them according to the resolution width that PHP-Nuke Titanium gets from your browser.</p>\n\n<p>This was written with the Last Seen block in mind. Someone once asked me why I changed the function for last seen. I never changed it I added a Titanium mod that changes the way the last seen data was displayed. I guess now you have a more declarative answer about why I did that.</p>\n\n<p>This block my friends gives you a perfect example of why PHP-Nuke was designed with a tabular theme interface. It had future ideas for things that had not yet been done. There is what is called a Flat page design and that is when we would use only HTML5 or CSS to layout a web page.</p>\n\n<p>PHP-Nuke Titanium is not a Flat design and never will be. PHP-Nuke Titanium was designed around the idea that people in a community who were just starting out learning PHP or HTML could or would be able to create blocks, modules, or themes with relative ease.</p>\n\n<p>This can be done in CSS and HTML5 and PHP-Nuke Evolution totally allows and supports themes of this design nature, however for Fluid resizeable responsive themes that might be displayed on TVs or extremely wide monitors it is not recommended. Why? PHP-Nuke Titanium was built on the backbone of Theme technology that was written more than 30 years ago. PHP-Nuke Titanium (US Version) supports XHTML, HTML, HTML5, and XML, so with this being the case anyone can design a theme and nobody has limitations when it comes to designing a block, module, or theme layout for their website.</p>\n\n<p>PHP-Nuke Titanium was created for folks that like bling and beautiful graphics. If you want a Flat design layout with 3 colors and no graphics then use something plain, you know like wearing a white T-Shirt everywhere every day.</p>', '', 0, 243, 6, 'WebMaster', '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 65, 13, '', 0, 1),

When you pass the mantle so to speak you expect the person that takes over to use an overly gracious amount of emphasis on the authors, developers, and contributors that made it all possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let me start out by explaining why I&#39;m using my real name as a contributor. I have been around and taken part in the development of just about every piece of code that is a part of PHP-Nuke. Short of off branding my own changes over the years, the truth is the dynamic <strong>FRANCIS framework</strong> of <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong> is what made all of it possible. I have been a part of all the developer communities over the last 30 years under different various nicknames or callsigns if you will, and with that being said,&nbsp;I guess you would have a hard time giving me credit unless I started using my real name. <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong> is open-source and for the most part, belongs to the developer communities that kept it alive, and the folks who are still keeping it alive after 30 years. The reason I am using my real name now is I have noticed a few people stirring the shit pot about people stealing code and saying it isn&#39;t&nbsp;theirs when in fact it truly is. The fact&nbsp;in the matter is that after it is modified it is no longer the original and anything modified must contain the new author&#39;s information. With that being said let&#39;s get class rolling...</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re going to have something to say about who is claiming something is theirs make sure you do your homework before you start running your mouth and offending people old enough to be your grandfather, while at the same time making yourself look like a complete idiot. Let&#39;s start off with re-branded public and commercial software rights. The GNU general public license allows everyone to distribute and or sell their own version of <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong> or any software released under the GNU License and with any name that they so choose to use. You can legally sell software with a GPL license version 2 or 3 for whatever price you want to charge and interestingly enough we could sell the original software un-modified if we so choose to do so. This can all be pretty confusing to folks that do not have at least a&nbsp;4th year of college reading and comprehension. Let me explain something,&nbsp;free software is referred to as free in terms of freedom and not in terms of the software price. What most people do is charge a distribution fee for different various renditions of software that other people have written the core engines for. Technically speaking anything you modify and change is yours and ipso facto makes you the current author, in fact, the original authors would usually prefer not to have their name attached to any version but the original and that is why as part of the law and why you are required to give a full copy of the original code un-modified with any version that you so choose to sell or distribute. There are exceptions with worldwide distributions such as <strong>PHP-Nuke</strong> because the original source code is already out there and very well known and there is no real need to emphasize on who is responsible for the ideas or concepts that went into the development of that particular software. However in court, if you did not supply a full copy that is un-modified alongside the original with the original author information, because the law is the law, you would lose any said battles that pertain to any such revenues earned.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough GNU copyrights are only legal if you provide your legal given name or the name of a legally registered business entity. With that being said you can&#39;t say copyright StarMonkey or Fragglenap. It must be your legally given birth name or a registered business entity. You cannot make up an entity name and use it without owning and registering it. A registered domain does not constitute any legal rights to the name you use. You must still register it as a legal trademark or license it as a business entity and this applies to everyone no matter where they are in the world. You may own the domain name and not have the name rights. So if you use a name make sure you license or register it as a trademark or business otherwise someone could steal it in about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What can happen is, you make someone angry and said person is quite wealthy, said person decides that they no longer like you, they register your domain as a trademark and then they license in your state or community under said name&nbsp;and then they drag you into court and sue your pants off.</p>\n\n<p>Do yourself a favor, make sure you own any name that you decide to use...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 460, 5, 'WebMaster', '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 35, 7, '', 0, 1),

But, ironically, most projects hosted publicly on GitHub aren&#39;t open source, at least according to the letter of open source law.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron Williamson, a lawyer specializing in open source issues, analyzed over 1.7 million public GitHub code repositories earlier this year, and of these, only 14.9 percent had clearly specified an open source license, as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/18/github_licensing_study/\" target=\"_blank\">reported by&nbsp;<em>The Register</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Developers sharing code publicly on GitHub agree to a terms of service that allows other users to view and copy code, but if a license isn&#39;t explicitly chosen, other developers won&#39;t have the right to actually change or redistribute the code. According to the definition set by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://opensource.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Source Initiative</a>&nbsp;(OSI), a license isn&#39;t considered open source unless it grants users permission to not just view source code but also modify code and distribute their changes.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub, however, is taking steps to address the issue. Users are now prompted to select an OSI approved open source license when they create a new code repository on the service. Users aren&#39;t forced to select a license, but if they select &quot;No License,&quot; they&#39;ll get a warning explaining that &quot;nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The change is a huge reversal for GitHub, says James Governor, co-founder of the IT industry analysis firm&nbsp;<a href=\"http://redmonk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RedMonk</a>. &quot;Something they said was unnecessary and not their role, is now apparently necessary, and part of their role,&quot; he says. &quot;Pragmatism wins. Customers win. But 22 year old software developers may be confused.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To reduce confusion, GitHub prompts developers to select only from a small list of licenses, and has built a site called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">choosealicense.com</a>&nbsp;to explain the differences between them.</p>\n\n<p>Williamson thinks the change is a good thing, but he isn&#39;t sold on the execution. &quot;Just including the option will encourage developers to consider licensing from the outset of their projects, and leave fewer new projects in license limbo,&quot; he says. But he also says that GitHub&#39;s education program is too simplistic.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;With such a short list, their choices can&#39;t help but appear rather political: MIT over BSD, GPLv2 over v3 (or AGPL), and an emphasis on permissive licenses,&quot; he says. GitHub includes links to a few other licenses, but it&#39;s still a short list relative to the myriad options available. &quot;Community organizations like the Free Software Foundation, the Open Source Initiative, and the Software Freedom Law Center have been working to educate developers about the available license choices for a long time; if GitHub wants to get involved in license education, it should consider reaching out to these organizations and to the community.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>By &quot;permissive licensing,&quot; Williamson is referring to software licenses, such as the MIT, BSD and Apache licenses that allow developers and companies to include open source code in non-open source products. This stands in contrast to &quot;copyleft&quot; licenses, such as the GPL and AGPL, which require developers to release any changes they make to the code under the same license. GitHub&#39;s emphasis on permissive licensing likely reflects a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/cloudera-and-apache/\" target=\"_blank\">general shift towards these licenses</a>&nbsp;in the open source community.</p>\n\n<p>And there&#39;s another challenge for opens source licensing. &quot;Of course, while this is a good step toward improving license disclosure among GitHub projects, it won&#39;t guarantee accuracy,&quot; says Williamson. For example, it&#39;s possible that not every piece of code used in an open source project will use the same license. For instance, a project using an MIT license may include some code from a different project that used an Apache license. The use of multiple licenses needs to be communicated to developers that want to modify and redistribute the project. But Williamson notes that this problem isn&#39;t specific to GitHub, anyone incorporating open source code from other projects has to deal with this.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, this is a step in the right direction for GitHub.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/author/klint-finley\" target=\"_blank\">Klint Finley</a>&nbsp;is a contributing writer for WIRED covering tech policy, software development, cloud computing, and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CONTRIBUTOR</strong></p>', '', 0, 35, 1, 'webmaster', '', 1, '', 0, 0, 0, 35, 7, '', 0, 1),

The new one is awesome and works great. I&#39;m not sure people really understand how important this little module is.

We have taken over and will update all the code and probably add features. There is a lot of room for improvement and the project almost seems like it was abandoned in the development stages early on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The OpenSource community has taken over the development of Flash rendering and like we said, there is absolutely no way to stop the world from creating new Flash movies and Games, and it will continue to do so just like before.<br />\n<br />\nAdobe choked a lot of people who their sole corporate incomes involved the use of Flash and by doing so a few went out of business or bankrupt.<br />\n<br />\nWe say shame on you Adobe you should know better.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe bought Macromedia and even with their business experience did not have what it takes to keep it going.<br />\n<br />\nAdobe has been known to buy companies just to horde them and destroy them. In their effort they shut down Fireworks and fired a lot of employees that depended upon the income they made managing the project.</p>\n\n<p>They also fired all the people involved in managing Adobe Flash Professional.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe is a company that is full of greed and transformed their corporation into a monthly cash cow.</p>\n\n<p>They take advantage of end users by charging monthly fees.</p>\n\n<p>We say when you buy something its yours and you own it. They should have let us have updates for free after we purchase something.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe is the poster child for greed and they started by charging people monthly fees to use Adobe PDF.</p>\n\n<p>They are a big company and we need their services but the sad thing is they are destine for failure. When you screw over the folks that made you what you are today, it will only be a matter of time before the OpenSource programming world destroys them. You can&#39;t stay in business when you screw your community buyers.</p>\n\n<p>This is what happens when you let some youngin who is still wet behind the ears make board decisions like getting rid of Flash, and or Fireworks.</p>\n\n<p>They still have time to do the right thing and stop robbing their end users but the likelihood of that happening is very grim.</p>\n\n<p>We only wish we knew who was directly responsible so we could make them a nice meme.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe said &quot;oh we retired flash&quot; like as if after we all bought their software that they had the right to say we can&#39;t use it anymore. That in short terms is theft and they robbed the people that put them in the position they are in today.</p>\n\n<p>We all gave them the money that they used to cripple and destroy Macromedia. In the end, the OpenSource communities will cripple and destroy Adobe...</p>\n\n<p>We all know that Microsoft led the way with their corporate greed. Microsoft knows if you make the wrong people mad it can cost you. Microsoft could have cared less and they led the way for others to start charging monthly fees and upgrade fees.</p>\n\n<p>All we can say is enjoy the fact that we are bringing flash back. A lot of programmers who spent over a decade learning to program with actionscript will probably be skeptical and they are still wandering around with the bad taste in their mouth of Adobe really sticking it to them. It&#39;s okay you can start to design new things and yes we have your back and now there will never be a way for Adobe to say &quot;oh we retired it&quot;. Adobe is shrinking even as I type and it&#39;s their own fault.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 173, 7, 'TheGhost', '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 40, 8, '', 0, 1),

In PHP, there are now many date-handling functions which means I don&#39;t have to treat dates like strings anymore. So, rather than him testing input dates and making sure they were in the right format, I just decided to insist on the correct format, the right way after hours of overlooking the obvious. Needless to say, I fixed it!</p>\n\n<p>While I was fixing that, I realized that if you do not select a topic it would throw an exception, so I fixed that. I added an Error Function specifically for the Blog system.</p>\n\n<p>I realize now more than ever, there needs to be a Question 2 Answer system. I&#39;m not sure who asked about that a while back but I will make that happen soon and it is a much-needed module that currently does not exist.</p>\n\n<p>I also thought maybe I would add a bridge system into the code so that we can use anything we like with the current build. I think I will build a check bridge! It will scan the database for certain tables and if it sees them it will activate the bridge automatically.</p>\n\n<p>I am also going to put in a theme bridge that will scan every theme for version information. It is possible to make any theme from any software work on the Fly!</p>\n\n<p>I can do just about anything and as I am going through all the code it seemed to spark a bazillion ideas!</p>\n\n<p>I will post more later, you all have a great evening.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 8, 7, 'TheGhost', '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, '', 0, 1),

Bear in mind that email is not the web and it&#39;s still positively antediluvian. Some email services do unspeakable things; I&#39;ve encountered one that blindly stripped all <strong>HTML</strong> tags (ignoring provided plain-text versions), and converted linked images to attachments, resulting in an unreadable mess. Even contemplating having inline styles working in the face of such vandalism is truly wishful.</p>\n\n<p>Want to know where the big hole is? <strong>Hotmail</strong>. <strong>Hotmail</strong>, <strong>live.com</strong>, and <strong>outlook.com</strong> strip or replace inline styles, yes, started as far back as 2013. Blame <strong>Microsoft</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hotmail</strong>, <strong>live</strong>, <strong>outlook.com</strong>, and <strong>outlook.</strong>&nbsp;They have all gotten considerably worse over the years (e.g. floats were dropped from <strong>outlook.com </strong>10 years ago, <strong>outlook</strong> dropped background images in 2007, and they&#39;ve not been seen since).</p>\n\n<p>Inline styles work in Gmail, but it strips anything outside the body tag. Some corporate mail filters (like <strong>BlackSpider</strong>/<strong>WebSense</strong>) do exactly the opposite, so if you want to be completely sure about your styling, you need to put a <strong>style tag</strong> in the <strong>head tag</strong>, another copy of it within the<strong> body</strong> (invalid, but it works), the <strong>same styles inline</strong> (look at the <a href=\"http://premailer.dialect.ca\" target=\"_blank\">premailer</a> project), and finally the <strong>same styling</strong> using <strong>font tags</strong>. Yes, it&#39;s insane, but no amount of wishing is going to make the problem go away. You can of course drop some of these, but by doing so you&#39;re implicitly accepting that it&#39;s not going to look the same in some places. You need to look at your audience - a new mobile music site can probably get away with it, but a corporate pension provider probably needs to be living in 2003 font-tag land.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, <strong>Apple</strong> <strong>Mail</strong>, <strong>iOS Mail</strong>, and <strong>iCloud</strong> all have vastly superior <strong>HTML</strong> handling as their&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2ecc71\">Campaign Monitor table</span> shows, as does <a href=\"http://www.email-standards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the email standards project</a>. With the majority of mobile reading using some flavor of <strong>WebKit</strong>, rendering on mobile is generally much more consistent (and mostly better) which sucks because most of us can afford desktops and use them on the daily.</p>\n\n<p>You could simply say that it&#39;s not worth the effort - anyone using crappy mail readers clearly doesn&#39;t care that much what their email looks like, but that doesn&#39;t mean that your styling isn&#39;t going to break.</p>\n\n<p>The old <strong>FONT</strong> tag is needed to achieve some email styling, for example changing the color of an anchor is something that is hard in different email clients, this will not work well in some clients:<br />\n&lt;a href=&quot;url-here&quot;style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; but this will work in most all the cases: &lt;a href=&quot;url-here&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</p>\n\n<p>I say all these companies and developers need to move with the time and fix all this so inline styling is all that will be needed!</p>\n\n<p>Holy shit, why are all HTML/e-mail developers and companies stuck in 2003?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 14, 1, 'TheGhost', '', 0, '', 0, 0, 0, 15, 3, '', 0, 1),
